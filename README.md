# Drew Roberts Contract Standard

This repository is for updating & explaining the features of my Standard ERC-20 Token Contract. The contract is designed for optimized performance of long-term Ethereum token projects on Mainnet or a Layer 2. It removes all concern from token holders of nefarious behavior as there are no functions even available that could be misused by the project. The ultimate goal is to encourage transaction volume at launch and subsequent accumalation of tokens into the hands of long-term supporters of the project, fostering a strong community.

I believe in the Web3 Ethos of "Verify don't Trust" and have been in the industry for over a decade and will remain for decades to come. As such, creating long-term relationships with project founders and their teams are of utmost importance to me. I value creating a Win-Win Situation for all parties, especially token holders. If I am the developer of a project, you can expect the following commitment from me and the team.
